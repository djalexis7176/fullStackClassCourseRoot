// STEP 1 Give me an example of:
//  a numeric literal expression,  number encompaases integers and decimals,: 100 , 3.14 or -250
//  a string literal expression, this is words put together in quotes: 'I am starting to get this!' , 'Yes I am!'
// a Boolean literal expression, a Boolean is expressed as either true or false: true 
// and a null literal expression. expresses a deliberate nothing or empty value that is negative on purpose or in action (it is different from undefined because that is something that has a value but has not been assigned yet). the null expression is: null

{
// STEP 2 Give me two examples of complex / variable expressions.
let x = 10;
let y = 5;


let sum = x + y; // This is a complex expression that adds two variables together.
}


{
let strfirstName = "John";
let strmiddleName = "Jacob";
let strlastName = "Hinkle Heimer Schmidt";

let strfullName = strfirstName + " " + strmiddleName + " " + strlastName; // This is a complex expression that concatenates three string variables to create a full name.
}
console.log(strfullName)
{ 

 prompt("Please enter your first name:");
let strfirstNameYou = prompt("Hello there " + strfirstNameYou);

}


// STEP 3 Declare (but do not assign) 9 variables for the following identifiers: First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Your Age, Referral Source, May We Contact You. Use Camel Casing and Hungarian Notation when naming your identifiers.

{ 

let strFirstName;
let strLastName;
let strAddress;
let strCity;
let strState;
let strZipCode;
let intYourAge;
let strReferral_Source;
let blnMayWeContactYou


let some_month
function the Month()
let current-month
let summer_month
let MyLibrary-function
}

// STEP 4 Use the document.write(), console.log(), alert(), confirm(), and prompt() methods in your code. Each method should be used at least once. You can use the same method more than once if you like, but you must use each of the five methods at least once.

{
    document.write("This is a document dot write code")
}

document.write("This is a document dot write code")
console.log("hello world this is console log")

alert("this is an alert message pop up!")
confirm("are you sure you want to run this?")
prompt( message: 'put your name here:')
